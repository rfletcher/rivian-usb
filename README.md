# rivian-usb

## What is This?

**Short answer:** It's a smart USB drive for Rivians

**Longer answer:** Rivian vehicles support USB storage for video recordings, but
accessing those video files means unplugging from the vehicle, plugging into a
computer, and manually copying the files. With rivian-usb, the USB storage stays
plugged into your vehicle, and the files are automatically archived to your
destination of choice once you drive back into Wi-Fi range.
